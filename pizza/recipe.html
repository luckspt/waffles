    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>Water (110ml)</li>
        <li>Sugar (1 coffee spoon)</li>
        <li>Fresh baker yeast (10g)</li>
        <li>Flour (200g)</li>
        <li>Olive oil (10ml)</li>
        <li>Salt (1 coffee spoon)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the water, sugar and yeast in a bowl.<br/>Gently fold until the yeast is diluted.</li>
        <li>Add the oil, salt and floud.<br/>Knead with your hands until you get a fluffy and homogeneous dough.</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set aside at room temperature until doubled in volume.</li>
        <li>Place the dough on a bench sprinkled with flour, and it is ready to roll out in the desired way.</li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Rest of the pizza</h1>
    <h2>Base</h2>
    <ol>Cut garlic in very small pieces, add a dash of olive oil and turn on the stove. Let it braise.</ol>
    <ol>Join tomato pulp, add a little of sugar and mix it.</ol>

    <h2>Stuff on the pizza</h2>
    <p>I usually add salami/tuna, peach, pineapple and mushrooms</p>
    <p>When finished, cover with cheese. IMO closing the pizza as a calzone makes it better.</p>
